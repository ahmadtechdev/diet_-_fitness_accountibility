# 🔔 Firebase Notifications - Quick Start

## 🎉 What You Got

Your app now sends **real-time push notifications** when partners add junk food entries!

**Example:**
When your partner eats pizza, you get:
```
💪 Exercise Time!
Your love ate Pizza! You have 170 exercises to do.
100 JR + 50 SQ + 20 PU
```

## 🚀 Quick Setup (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies ✅
Already done! Your dependencies are installed.

### Step 2: Deploy Cloud Functions 🔴 CRITICAL

```bash
# Terminal commands:
cd functions
npm install
firebase login
firebase deploy --only functions
```

**⚠️ Without this, notifications won't work!**

### Step 3: Test It

1. Install app on **Device 1**
2. In `lib/main.dart` line 33, set: `await notificationService.initialize('him');`
3. Install app on **Device 2**  
4. In `lib/main.dart` line 33, set: `await notificationService.initialize('her');`
5. Add junk food on Device 1
6. Device 2 gets notification! 🎊

## 📚 Learn How It Works

### The Complete Flow

```
1. Partner adds junk food
   ↓
2. NotificationService.create() → Creates Firestore document
   ↓
3. Cloud Function detects new document → Triggers automatically
   ↓
4. Cloud Function reads partner's FCM token → Gets target device
   ↓
5. Cloud Function sends via FCM API → Firebase delivers notification
   ↓
6. Partner receives notification → Sees exercise details
```

### Key Files Explained

**`notification_service.dart`** - Your notification manager
- Gets FCM token
- Saves to Firestore
- Loads partner's token
- Creates notification requests

**`functions/index.js`** - The notification sender
- Listens for Firestore changes
- Reads notification documents
- Sends via FCM API

**`food_tracker_controller.dart`** - The trigger
- When junk food added
- Calls notification service
- Passes exercise details

## 🎓 What You Learned

**Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM):**
- ✅ How push notifications work
- ✅ FCM tokens and their purpose
- ✅ Foreground vs background handling
- ✅ Cloud Functions integration
- ✅ Firestore as notification queue

**Flutter Implementation:**
- ✅ flutter_local_notifications setup
- ✅ Permission requests
- ✅ Real-time stream listeners
- ✅ Error handling & fallbacks

**Architecture:**
- ✅ Separation of concerns
- ✅ Service pattern
- ✅ Repository pattern
- ✅ Event-driven design

## 🔧 Configuration Done

- ✅ Dependencies added (`firebase_messaging`, `flutter_local_notifications`)
- ✅ Android permissions configured
- ✅ FCM meta-data added
- ✅ Background handler setup
- ✅ Notification service created
- ✅ Controllers updated
- ✅ Cloud Functions code ready

## ⚠️ Remaining Steps

**YOU NEED TO:**
1. Deploy Cloud Functions (see Step 2 above)
2. Set user IDs on both devices
3. Test notifications

## 💡 Pro Tips

**For Production:**
- Add Firebase Authentication first
- Store server key securely
- Implement notification preferences
- Add analytics tracking

**For Testing:**
- Use Firebase Console to monitor
- Check function logs frequently
- Test all three app states
- Verify token refresh works

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**No notifications?**
```bash
# Check if function is deployed
firebase functions:list

# View logs
firebase functions:log

# Check Firestore for tokens
# Firebase Console → Firestore → couples → default_couple → tokens
```

**Token not found?**
- Both users must open app once
- Check Firestore for saved tokens
- Manually call `refreshPartnerToken()`

## 📞 Ready to Deploy?

```bash
# One command to deploy everything:
cd functions && npm install && firebase deploy --only functions
```

**Then test it!** 🚀

---

**You now know how to implement Firebase push notifications!** This skill applies to any Flutter app. 💪

Good luck with your deployment! 🎉
